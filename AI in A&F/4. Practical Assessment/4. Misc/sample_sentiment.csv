62098,8432015,104511604,"26,09,16",56913477,Clemens,Youre renting a professionally serviced apartment at the Metropolitan YMCA of Singapore  Compared to a typical AirBnB where you are renting someones apartment this is a little more akin to staying at a very spacious hotel  There are pluses and minuses to that  On the plus side you benefit from a 24hour reception desk staffed with super friendly people who can help you with local transportation and other needs  Maids will come to make your beds empty your trash replace your towels etc  Very convenient You have to buy your own soap and shampoo though which seems a bit inconsistent  In addition the apartment is clean and uncluttered and there are no personal belongings of anyone to get in your way  On the downside youre not really living like a local and the normal charm that you experience when you rent someones home is noticeably missing  All the basic essentials that you need are there just as described but you wont find anything else  The friendly people from reception will bring you a toaster and a coffee maker and a few other things based on your needs if you ask for them but they are not automatically there as they would be in anyones home In fact little details make it obvious that noone has ever lived in this apartment for an extended period of time eg the fridge door opens the wrong way  Also note that there is no dish washer and that the washerdryer is a single unit and drying takes a long time  youll quickly put your clothes on the rack to dry Upon departure youll pay extra for electricity and water based on the actual meter reading just as described but dont worry about it this is fairly cheap in our case it ended up being about 05 of the rental fee  A few other things to note the pool is large and very clean but it is in front of the building and its location is not particularly inviting weve never seen anyone use it in the 10 days we stayed there The apartment has been recently renovated eg the beds are excellent the bathrooms are new the kitchen seems partially new but the overall impression of the building and the apartment still feels a bit dated eg the carpets and furniture appear to be 20 years old  Wifi was fast and worked very well  The location is quiet yet fairly central  Bus stop in front 7 min walk to the MRT which is fantastic  Basic groceries are a 10 min walk away or take a very cheap taxi if you go shopping Overall we had a good stay and have no complaints  It was just a bit different than what we were used to from other AirBnBs  Oh one thing to repeat the people are really very very nice,2655,en,0.9881,0.036,0.867,0.097,
