============Problem statement============
Airbnb allows its hosts to price their properties. 
There is a lack of indicators that allow hosts to 
compare similar listings in their neighbourhood. 
This has resulted in a suboptimal pricing. As a 
co-founder of a promising start-up, you intend to 
solve this problem using state of the art machine 
learning and natural language processing techniques 
to advise Airbnb on how to market their property 
for the best returns.

============Some Questions of interest============
The hosts on Airbnb experiment and charge an optimal 
price. So, can we recommend an optimal price the host 
should charge for the new listing? It is uncertain 
when a listing is hosted or when it becomes unavailable. 
Are we able to predict whether certain listing is going 
to be more popular than the others?
